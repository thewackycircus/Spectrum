This is a mobile app I made for univeristy mobile development modules across years 2 and 3.

It allows users to shake the phone and generate colours as well as use touhc to colur pick colours from a colour wheel png. These colours are stord in a palette which can be saved and uplaoded onto firebase where it can be accessed from other instances of the app. The user can also sign in via Google.

when a user saves a palette, they are prompted to give it a name. The palette uploaded to Firebase consists of a list of colours, a name and a google ID. The latter two can be used via a search bar to filter through palettes in a palette list view.

If I were to take this project further, I would add more social aspects to the app, such as a user profile page that displays a users liked and uploaded palettes, as well as the ability to follow other users and like their palettes.
